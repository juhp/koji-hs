[Koji](https://pagure.io/koji/) is a distributed RPM-based buildsystem,
controlled by a Koji Hub server.

This koji-hs project provides the Haskell koji package,
a library with bindings to the Koji XML-RPC API.

It is a WIP: currently only querying koji is working,
ie login authentication or building etc is supported yet.

## Building

Build with `stack` or `cabal new-build`.

## Usage

Due to haxr using HsOpenSSL, programs using this library
need to be linked with `ghc-options: -threaded`, otherwise
the ghc RTS will complain with a runtime error.

See the Haddock documentation for more details.
